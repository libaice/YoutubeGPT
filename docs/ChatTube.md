### ChatTube Docs



#### 1. Experience > Summarization

Many of the plugins we see today offer a summarization feature, condensing content into key points. However, upon careful consideration, during a Youtube video, moments that provoke deep thinking often come from a particular second, a specific phrase, or a certain image. Summarization serves as an outline and summarizes content but doesn't necessarily inspire us. That's where ChatTube comes in, providing an active approach to seek these "Eureka" moments.

#### 2. Driven by Interest and Curiosity

Mastering something often takes a considerable amount of time, and sustained interest can make this process enjoyable. The more we engage, the more fun it becomes. ChatTube introduces an active information-seeking approach, shifting from passive reception of information. For example, we can feed all of Steve Jobs' videos to the bot, assign it the role of Steve Jobs, and start a conversation. Our brains do not think linearly and are often discontinuous. The thrill of exploring new topics often leads to a more focused and curious mindset.

#### 3. Engaging Conversations with Interesting Minds

Founded in 1998 by John Brockman, the Edge organization hosts an annual gathering of distinguished figures from various scientific fields, including Nobel laureates. One can only imagine the excitement of participating in these discussions, hearing directly from Daniel Kahneman about how the brain thinks, or from Nassim Nicholas Taleb about probability theory and systemic risk, or from astrophysicists about their exploration of the cosmos. With ChatTube, it's no longer one-way communication. We're having conversations.

#### 4. Time-traveling Iterations

Furthermore, we can even train these personalities into individual "persons." Just as we might initiate a conversation on Twitter Spaces, we could bring in figures like Qin Shi Huang, Charles Darwin, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Steve Jobs for a chat. And they can continuously learn and discuss a wide range of interesting topics.

#### 5. Voice and Text

Humans have known about text for less than a thousand years, with the invention of the movable-type printing press by Bi Sheng around 1045 and Johannes Gutenberg around 1450. However, the vast majority of people didn't gain literacy until after the 1978 reforms in China. In contrast, spoken language has existed for at least 100,000 years. Humans understand and are more familiar with spoken language than text. Voice is for expressing, text for recording - the former is significantly faster than the latter. It's hard to imagine a scenario where everyone uses typing for meetings.

#### 6. Talk 2 Earn Economic Model Design

We can devise a new set of indicators to measure the density of new knowledge. In the past, Youtubers would create videos based on their own knowledge, with ads serving as third-party services. The new economic model envisions users generating novel ideas after watching a video, which can lead to more interesting creations. The users, through their talk, provide a feedback loop to the system. They can earn tokens corresponding to this measure, which can be used to pay for third-party advertiser fees, platform revenue, and creator income. Creators can also use tokens to boost their own user base.

Every stakeholder is on a growth path: users gain new knowledge, creators get revenue and more feedback, the platform garners more user and creator support, and third-party advertisers achieve more income. This transitions the system from a one-way creation relationship to a mutually encouraging, two-way interaction.
